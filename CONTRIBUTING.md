# CONTRIBUTING

Hi there, thanks for your interest but I'm already finding it hard to manage categorising and organising all these modules and not currently accepting contributions but feel free to fork and make any changes you require.

If you feel that there has been an error or something needs to be changed feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/canute24/useful-modules/issues).

For anything else please start a [Discussion](https://github.com/canute24/useful-modules/discussions)
